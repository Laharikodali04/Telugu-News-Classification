# Telugu News Classification using NLP and Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying Telugu news articles into different categories
using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning models.
Both baseline ML and Transformer-based approaches are implemented.

## 🗂 Dataset
- train_telugu_news.csv
- test_telugu_news.csv
- The dataset contains Telugu news text along with category labels.

## 📓 Project Notebooks
1. **telugu_news_classification_baseline.ipynb**
   - Text preprocessing
   - TF-IDF feature extraction
   - Machine Learning classification models

2. **telugu_news_classification_transformer.ipynb**
   - Transformer-based Telugu news classification
   - Improved contextual understanding of Telugu text
